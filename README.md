# Roadmap

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics. - Done in v0.1.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile.
3. Relics inspired by Honda, Dhalsim, Blanka and Zangief.
4. The same, by Boxer, Claw and Sagat. (about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
5. Focus in Dictator's inspired relic. (only in his relic because it will use the Friendly Minions mod)
6. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
7. Relics inspired by Cammy, Fei Long and Deejay.
8. ?????????????????????
9. ?????????????????????????????????????????
10. Finding/doing art assets and adding them to the mod.
11. Translating to PT-BR.
12. Polishing and balancing.
13. Challenges for Custom Games where you start with a specific Street Fighter's relics.
14. Synergy and adaptation with other mods.
