# Quarter Circle Forward PUNCH!
A Slay The Spire mod, which adds primarily relics directly inspired by fighters from Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers...

# Ever Changing Current Roadmap (yes, this can change depending of circunstances)

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics. - Done in v0.1.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile. - Done in v0.11.
3. Add Custom Modifiers (and other small stuff) related with the major theme. - Done in v0.11.
4. Small improvement in FX and relic images, polishing of content in general. - Done.
5. Mod release! Release at Github and Steam. (all future milestones, when finished, shall have proper releases) - Done.

- (thanks to rl issues, a pause will be made in this mod's development but 16 relics will be done already when finishing the fourth milestone)

6. Relics inspired by Cammy, Dhalsim, Blanka, Zangief and a secret guest.
7. Starting support to Nexus Mods.
8. One boss relic for Boxer, Claw, Sagat and Dictator, respectively. (about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
9. Focus in Akuma's inspired relic.
10. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
11. Relics inspired by Fei Long and Deejay. (number unknown)
12. ?????????????????????
13. Undefined extra content.
14. Test of 1 Custom Modifier revolving around fighter's set relics to make the equivalent of mini-characters, as a test. (use Blademaster Perk system together with relic that triggers them)
15. Reworking of other Custom Modifiers to have more mini-characters, IF I'm fine with the results above
16. Update of beta art and sound assets to v1.0
17. Polishing, refactoring and balancing.

(and here we reach v1.0)

18. Translation of the mod to PT-BR. (all future milestones will launch with EN localization, PT-BR will come after a round of balancing)

(mandatory 1 month break at this point for resting and recovering creative energies)

19. Synergy and adaptation with Infinite Spire. (Black cards? Black cards. o9)
20. Boss inspired by Street Fighter 2 stuff.
21. Synergy with Halation. (Simulated Spire? Yep.)
22. Synergy and adaptation with other mods. (Googly Eyes included)

And MAYBE in the future, for a v2.0 (not making promises here)

23. Elite monsters.
24. Extra events.
25. Cards inspired by moves of fighting games (and here I include Smash), that can be get through events or other mod's access to a hidden character.
26. Special shop with stuff from this mod (cards above mentioned included) and removal with a good discount.

# Requirements

Slay The Spire 1.1, Mod The Spire 3.11.0+, BaseMod 5.15.1+ and StSLib 1.17.1+ (when needed, the requirements will be updated to more recent versions of the game and libraries)

# Optional Requirements

None by now.

# Compatibility

* Vex's [The Artificer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1842757025) character mod does NOT use cards (the character does not have a deck!) or usual relics, so almost all content here, when used with that character should not work/work poorly.

* The [RumiaBox mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1633577327) has an effect through the Challenger Book relic which gives you as a reward, a double of a relic which you already has. There's one case already of this mod's Duffel Bag relic crashing a game when it applied its effect when a double from an old WW_Relics mod version was present. This will be tested and if possible, fixed in the future. So far, just don't get a second Duffel Bag if the possibility is available.

* The [Senshi mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1787031743)'s cards which have unique animations do not work well when used by characters that aren't The Senshi and crash the game as a result. That by itself is not a problem, but the Rainbow Brush modifier gives the Rainbow Brush relic, and since that relic can give cards of other character mods which are loaded...

...I can't recommend using that modifier with Senshi mod, if you aren't using the Senshi character.

## List of Incompatible Mods:

There are more than one hundred mods at Steam Workshop and who knows how many more outside of it, so I can't say that it won't crash your game in any possible mod combination. In case of it happening, open one issue, I will check it out.

THAT said... none that I know so far.

# Installation

Download the .jar in the latest release, then add it to SlayTheSpire/mods folder (if you already installed the requirements. If not, do it first).

# Special Thanks

To MegaCrit, the makes from SlayTheSpire, because the game is awesome and they are cool with mods of their game :D

The whole modding channel from the Discord's Slay The Spire server and all people who goes there to support and banter and laugh about modding the game and other things. You rock, fellows.

To game-icons.net, because without it the mod probably would not have proper temporary icons for its relics.

To Robert C. Martin because of his book [Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/), since without it, oh boy this mod's code would be way harder to read...
