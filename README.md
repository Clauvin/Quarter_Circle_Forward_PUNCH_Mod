# World Warrior's Relics
A Slay The Spire mod, which adds primarily relics inspired by fighters from Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers, and get some inspiration from the rest of the Street Fighter franchise.

# Content

* Five relics done of 16+ planned, with placeholder image and sound.
* Six game modifiers, ranging from adding more relics at start to making the game harder.

# Current State

Walking towards roadmap's milestone 2 (and simultaneously doing stuff from milestone 3).

# Relics

Link in the [wiki's page](https://github.com/Clauvin/World_Warriors_Relics/wiki/Relics).

# Roadmap

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics. - Done in v0.1.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile.
3. Add Custom Modifiers (and other small stuff) related with last milestone's relics and the major theme.
4. Translation of the mod's created text so far to PT-BR. (all future milestones will launch with EN and PT-BR localization)
5. Relics inspired by Honda, Dhalsim, Blanka and Zangief.
6. The same, by Boxer, Claw and Sagat. (about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
7. Focus in Dictator's inspired relic. (only in his relic because it will use the Friendly Minions mod)
8. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
9. Relics inspired by Cammy, Fei Long and Deejay.
10. ?????????????????????
11. Update of art and sound assets.
12. Polishing, refactoring and balancing.
13. Synergy and adaptation with other mods.

# Requirements

Mod The Spire 3.9.2+, BaseMod 5.12.1+ and StSLib 1.15.0+.

# Compatibility

This mod adds some code to the Upgrades of all base Powers and Skills that has 2-cost or more, that when upgraded reduce their own costs by one, to make them work as they look like in game with the Spiky Bracers relic.

This means that mods which alter such cards MAY be incompatible and result in unpredicted behavior. If/when such mods are detected, they will be listed below. Such problem may be fixed in the future, but no promises are made.

## List of Incompatible Mods:



# Installation

Download the .jar in the latest release, then add it to SlayTheSpire/mods folder (if you already installed the requirements. If not, do both things first).
