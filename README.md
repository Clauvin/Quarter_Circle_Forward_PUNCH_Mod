# World Warriors' Relics
A Slay The Spire mod, which adds primarily relics directly inspired by fighters from Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers and gets some inspiration from the rest of the Street Fighter franchise.

# Content

* Fourteen relics done of 16+ planned, with temporary images and placeholder sounds.
* Seven game modifiers, ranging from adding more relics at start to making the game harder.
* Six cards, acessible through one specific relic.

# Current State

Walking towards roadmap's milestone 2 (and simultaneously doing stuff from milestone 3).

# Roadmap

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics. - Done in v0.1.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile.
3. Add Custom Modifiers (and other small stuff) related with last milestone's relics and the major theme. (future relic milestones will add Custom Modifiers too)
4. Translation of the mod's created text so far to PT-BR. (all future milestones will launch with EN localization, PT-BR will come after a round of balancing)
5. Mod release! Release at Github, Steam and Nexus Mods. (all future milestones, when finished, shall have proper releases)

- (thanks to rl issues, a pause will be made in this mod's development but 16 relics will be done already when finishing the fourth milestone)

6. Relics inspired by Honda, Dhalsim, Blanka and Zangief.
7. One boss relic for Boxer, Claw and Sagat, respectively. (about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
8. Focus in Dictator's inspired relic. (only in his relic because it will use the Friendly Minions mod)
9. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
10. Relics inspired by Cammy, Fei Long and Deejay. (number unknown)
11. ?????????????????????
12. Reworking of 2 Custom Modifier revolving around fighter's set relics to make the equivalent of mini-characters. (use Blademaster Perk system, perhaps, together with linked relics?) (can this be added to the main character screen?)
13. Reworking of at least more 2 Custom Modifiers to have more mini-characters.
14. Update of beta art and sound assets to release version

(and here we reach v1.0)

15. Polishing, refactoring and balancing.
16. Synergy and adaptation with Infinite Spire. (Black cards? Black cards. o9)
17. Boss inspired by Street Fighter 2 stuff.
18. Synergy and adaptation with other mods.

And MAYBE (not making promises here)

19. Cards inspired by moves of fighting games (and here I include Smash), that can be get through events or other mod's access to a hidden character.
20. Special shop with stuff from this mod (cards above mentioned included) and removal with a good discount.
21. Elite monsters.
22. Extra events.

# Requirements

Mod The Spire 3.9.2+, BaseMod 5.12.1+ and StSLib 1.15.0+.

# Compatibility

So far, it shouldn't cause problems to other mods. That said, there are more than one hundred mods at Steam Workshop and who knows how many more outside of it, so I can't say that it won't crash your game in any possible mod combination. In case of it happening, open one issue, I will check it out.

## List of Incompatible Mods:

None that I know so far.

# Installation

Download the .jar in the latest release, then add it to SlayTheSpire/mods folder (if you already installed the requirements. If not, do it first).

# Special Thanks

To MegaCrit, the makes from SlayTheSpire, because the game is awesome and they are cool with mods of their game :D

The whole modding channel from the Discord's Slay The Spire server and all people who goes there to support and banter and laughs about modding the game and other things. You rock, fellows.

To game-icons.net, because without it the mod probably would not have proper temporary icons for its relics.
