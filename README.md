# World Warriors' Relics
A Slay The Spire mod, which adds primarily relics directly inspired by fighters from Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers and gets some inspiration from the rest of the Street Fighter franchise.

# Content

* Nine relics done of 16+ planned, with temporary images and placeholder sounds.
* Seven game modifiers, ranging from adding more relics at start to making the game harder.
* Zero cards done (but working on it) of 6 planned, accessible only through one relic.

# Current State

Walking towards roadmap's milestone 2 (and simultaneously doing stuff from milestone 3).

# Roadmap

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics. - Done in v0.1.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile.
3. Add Custom Modifiers (and other small stuff) related with last milestone's relics and the major theme. (future relic milestones will add Custom Modifiers too)
4. Translation of the mod's created text so far to PT-BR. (all future milestones will launch with EN and PT-BR localization)

- (thanks to rl issues, a pause will be made in this mod's development but 16 relics will be done already when finishing 4)

5. Relics inspired by Honda, Dhalsim, Blanka and Zangief.
6. The same, by Boxer, Claw and Sagat. (about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
7. Focus in Dictator's inspired relic. (only in his relic because it will use the Friendly Minions mod)
8. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
9. Relics inspired by Cammy, Fei Long and Deejay.
10. ?????????????????????
11. New balanced Custom Modifiers revolving around fighter's set relics.
12. Update of art and sound assets.
13. Polishing, refactoring and balancing.
14. Synergy and adaptation with other mods.

# Requirements

Mod The Spire 3.9.2+, BaseMod 5.12.1+ and StSLib 1.15.0+.

# Compatibility

So far, it shouldn't cause problems to other mods. That said, there are 135 mods at Steam Workshop and who knows how many more outside of it, so I can't say that it won't crash your game in any possible mod combination. In case of it happening, open one issue, I will check it out.

## List of Incompatible Mods:

None that I know so far.

# Installation

Download the .jar in the latest release, then add it to SlayTheSpire/mods folder (if you already installed the requirements. If not, do it first).

# Special Thanks

To MegaCrit, the makes from SlayTheSpire, because the game is awesome and they are cool with mods of their game :D

The modding channel from the Discord's Slay The Spire server and all people who goes there to support and banter about modding the game. You rock, fellows.

To game-icons.net, because without it the mod probably would not have proper temporary icons for its relics.
