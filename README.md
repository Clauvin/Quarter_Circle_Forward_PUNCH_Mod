# World Warrior's Relics
A Slay The Spire mod, which adds relics inspired by fighters from Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers.

# Content

So far, nothing.

# Gameplay

Nada. Zilch.

# Current State

Nothing, just an almost empty repository in Github.

# Roadmap

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile.
3. Relics inspired by Honda, Dhalsim, Blanka and Zangief.
4. The same, by Boxer, Claw, Sagat and Dictator. (about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
5. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
6. Relics inspired by Cammy, Fei Long and Deejay.
7. ?????????????????????
8. Finding/doing art assets and adding them to the mod.
9. Translating to PT-BR.
10. Final polishing and balancing.
