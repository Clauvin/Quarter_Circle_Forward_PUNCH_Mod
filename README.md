# World Warrior's Relics
A Slay The Spire mod, which adds relics inspired by fighters from Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers.

# Content

So far, nothing. Plans are for 16+ relics, at least one for each fighter in SSF2: The New Challengers.

# Gameplay

Nada. Zilch.

# Current State

Nothing, just an almost empty repository in Github.

# Relics To Implement

| Name  | Rarity | Effect | Inspiration |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Red Headband | Common  | Each turn, discard the first Status or Curse card drawn, then draw another random card from the draw pile if there's any card there.  | Ryu's red headband and how it became his in the Alpha series. |

# Relics Implemented



# Roadmap

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile.
3. Relics inspired by Honda, Dhalsim, Blanka and Zangief.
4. The same, by Boxer, Claw and Sagat.(about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
5. Focus in Dictator's inspired relic. (only in his relic because it will use the Friendly Minions mod)
6. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
7. Relics inspired by Cammy, Fei Long and Deejay.
8. ?????????????????????
9. ?????????????????????????????????????????
10. Finding/doing art assets and adding them to the mod.
11. Translating to PT-BR.
12. Final polishing and balancing.
