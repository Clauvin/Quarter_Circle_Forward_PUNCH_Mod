# Roadmap

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics. - Done in v0.1.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile.
3. Translation of the mod's created text so far to PT-BR. (all future milestones will launch with EN and PT-BR localization)
4. Relics inspired by Honda, Dhalsim, Blanka and Zangief.
5. The same, by Boxer, Claw and Sagat. (about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
6. Focus in Dictator's inspired relic. (only in his relic because it will use the Friendly Minions mod)
7. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
8. Relics inspired by Cammy, Fei Long and Deejay.
9. ?????????????????????
10. Update of art and sound assets.
11. Polishing, refactoring and balancing.
12. Challenges for Custom Games where you start with a specific Street Fighter's relics (and problems included).
13. Synergy and adaptation with other mods.

# Requirements

Mod The Spire 3.8.3+, BaseMod 5.8.0+ and StSLib 1.1.4+.

# Compatibility

This mod adds some code to the Upgrades of all base Powers and Skills that has 2-cost or more, that when upgraded reduce their own costs by one, to make them work as they look like in game with the Spiky Bracers relic.

This means that mods which alter such cards MAY be incompatible and result in unpredicted behavior. If/when such mods are detected, they will be listed below. Such problem may be fixed in the future, but no promises are made.

## List of Incompatible Mods:



# Installation

Download the .jar in the latest release, then add it to SlayTheSpire/mods folder (if you already installed the requirements. If not, do both things first).
