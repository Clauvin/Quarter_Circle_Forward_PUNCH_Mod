A Slay The Spire mod, which adds relics inspired by fighters from Super Street Fighter 2: The New Challengers.

# Content

Two relics done of 16+ planned, with placeholder image and sound.

# Current State

Version 0.2.

# Relics To Implement

| Name  | Rarity | Effect | Inspiration |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Fighting Gloves | Rare | Upgrades outside of fights allow to upgrade one extra card. | Ryu's usual gloves. |
| Handcuffs | ??? | Your first attack that deals more than 12 unblocked damage in a single hit also stuns the enemy and give 2 Frail and 2 Weak. | Chun-Li as a policewoman. |


# Relics Implemented

| Name  | Rarity | Effect | Inspiration |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Duffel Bag | Uncommon | For the next 4 non-event, non-boss fights you win, gain in the first 1 Bandage Up, the second 1 Panacea and in each one of the last 2 fights 1 random common relic. | Ryu's duffel bag. |
| Red Headband | Common | Each turn, discard the first Status or Curse card drawn, then draw another random card from the draw pile if there's any card there. | Ryu's red headband and how it became his in the Alpha series. |
| White Boots | Uncommon | Can be used 1x per fight. Choose an attack in your hand. Create four copies of it, place them randomly in your draw pile, then exhaust the chosen card. The copies cost 1-less the first time they are used. | Chun-Li's boots from SF2.

# Roadmap

1. Create a relic based in Ryu, for basic testing and getting the hang of modding relics for Slay The Spire. Focus in mechanics and avoiding bugs, not graphics. - Done in v0.1.
2. Relics inspired by Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Guile.
3. Relics inspired by Honda, Dhalsim, Blanka and Zangief.
4. The same, by Boxer, Claw and Sagat.(about the names chosen here, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior#Regional_differences)
5. Focus in Dictator's inspired relic. (only in his relic because it will use the Friendly Minions mod)
6. Focus in T. Hawk relic (only in his relic because it will trigger events, and that's different from all the other relics so far)
7. Relics inspired by Cammy, Fei Long and Deejay.
8. ?????????????????????
9. ?????????????????????????????????????????
10. Finding/doing art assets and adding them to the mod.
11. Translating to PT-BR.
12. Polishing and balancing.
13. Synergy and adaptation with other mods.
